review/text: This was a very interesting dvd, but the let down is that the dvd is only 28 minutes long. i was really hoping for atleast an hour or more, but alas no. Again, what little video there is, is extremely interesting but short.

review/summary: The Earth is Hollow!
review/text: Now for the first time, this film presents the history, mythology & folklore that the earth has a hollow realm, a mystical and physical place, thought to house prehistoric animals, or hide alien beings bent on conquering the earth. The hollow earth theory is represented in the history of many diverse cultures throughout the world. The Avalon of Camelot, the Garden of Eden, Paradise Lost, Shangri-La and Valhalla are names assigned to a mystical and physical place thought by some to house prehistoric animals and plants and by others to hide alien beings bent on conquering the outer Earth. This fascinating video is a compilation of extensive research by the International Society for a the Complete Earth.* DVD * 40 min<br /><br />Rent me: UFOdvd com/rent/
